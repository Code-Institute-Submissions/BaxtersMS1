# **Baxters Pharmacy**

[View the live project here](https://asplesa.github.io/BaxtersMS1/).

This is the website for Baxters Pharmacy, a local community pharmacy. Baxters does not currently have an online presence. The website has been created to enable Baxters to be found online so that they can compete with local competitors and also to showcase the range of services that they offer.

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for existing and potential customers.

**User Experience (UX)**

In planning my development I considered the five planes of good UX design.

**Strategy:** This is a B2C website which has to appeal to a mass of audience of adults of all ages. As such the language I used could not be overly formal or technical. The aim was to portray a feeling openness and friendliness, while being professional at the same time.

**Scope:** The functional aim of the website is to be primarily informational in its content. The aim is to inform the user ie existing and potential customers of who we are, what do we offer and where we are based.

**Skeleton:** I used Balsamiq to create a basic wireframe prior to commencing development work. From this I created the basic structure of each page and the features for each one.

**Structure:** Once the basic wireframes were in place I determined the best flow for the website so that users could easily move through the site to find the information that they needed. I also expanded the content at this stage to ensure it was informative and consistent throughout the website.

**Surface:** At this stage I commenced development work on the website.

- **Design**

**Overall Design brief**

Baxters is a community pharmacy so the overall design theme is clean and modern. However it is important to portray a feeling of trust as they are a locally owned pharmacy as opposed to a large chain. This was achieved by showing images of the owners throughout the site.

**Colour Scheme**

As Baxters is part of TotalHealth I integrated the colours used by Totalhealth as part of the overall design. The two main colours in use are purple and green. Green is the primary colour used for branding with purple used as an accent shade. I also used the green colour for CTAs throughout the site. The colours used were:

Green #00B5CB rgb(0, 181, 203)

Purple #742E83 rgb(116, 46, 131)

Grey #777777 rgb(119, 119, 119)

**Typography**

Google Fonts was used – Roboto font family as the main font throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn&#39;t being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is contemporary, modern, minimalistic, and clean which ties in with our overall design theme.

**Imagery**

Imagery is very important. The images help to develop trust with the user. By using images of the pharmacy owners it conveys that feeling of being approachable and friendly. The images of the owners are front and centre, building a relationship with the user/customer before they even enter the shop.

- **Wireframes**

I created the wireframe in Balsamiq which I then exported to **pdf.** See [link here](https://github.com/asplesa/BaxtersMS1/blob/5b1b2dd61ad0747e6b7ee0535fcec28f6894a1b4/readme-assets/baxters-wireframe-ms1.pdf).

- Responsive on all device sizes
- 4 pages – Home, About, Services, Contact.
- Bootstrap NavBar used so the user can navigate the site easily.
- Booking form to enable users to book the flu vaccine.
- Social Media links on the footer of each page.

**Testing**

**HTML/CSS:** The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

**Links:** All internal and external links on the site were checked and verified.

**UX/UI:** Upon entering the site users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. I used a navbar for semantic clarity to allow search engines to know that the links inside are specifically for navigation. The navbar is ordered in priority of information from left to right. So starting with the home-page, followed by the About page, to create trust with users, followed by services offered and the contact page.

A bold and central image of the owner smiling immediately creates a feeling of trust. The sense is extended in the About us page where I included images of the owners along with a bio to create a sense of knowing your local pharmacist.

**Resposiveness:** I designed the site as a mobile first site. Bootstrap was used throughout the site to facilitate this and I tested the responsiveness on a number of devices and Dev tools.

**Accessibility:** I used [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) to test the accessibility of the site.

**User Story Testing**

  - **Site Owner Goals**

    1. As a Site owner, I want to portray a sense of trust and transparency by explaining who I am and that I am locally owned business.

        On the About page I included smiling photos of the owners to create a sense of trust and friendliness. I also included a bio for each of the owners so customers could learn a little bit about the owners.

![About page](/readme-assets/about-image.JPG)

    2. As a Site owner, I want to be able to easily explain the list of services that I offer.

        On the Services page I listed a number of the services that are offered by the pharmacy along with a brief description of what each service is.

    3. As a Site owner, I want to communicate to customers what my opening hours at and how to contact me.

        On the Contact page I listed the opening hours of the pharmacy. I also included an easy to use contact us CTA.

![Contact page](/readme-assets/contact-image.JPG)

  - **Existing Customer Goals**

    1. As an Existing Customer, I want to know what your opening hours are.

        Opening hours are clearly displayed on the Contact page.

    2. As an Existing Customer, I want to know if you will deliver my prescriptions to me.

        This key service is prominently displayed on the homepage with a link to the Services page if customers wish to read more.

    3. As an Existing Customer, I want to find community links.

        I included the social links in the footer of all pages.

  - **Potential Customer Goals**

    1. As a Potential Customer, I want to see who owns the pharmacy and can I trust them.

        On the About page I included smiling photos of the owners to create a sense of trust and friendliness. I also included a bio for each of the owners so customers could learn a little bit about the owners

    2. As a Potential Customer, I want to check where you are located.

        On the Contact page I listed the opening hours of the pharmacy and also a map so that users can see exactly where the shop is located in the town. I also included the address and contact details in the footer of each page for ease of use.

    3. As a Potential Customer, I want to know if I can get the flu vaccination.

        This service is prominently displayed on the homepage with a link to the Services page if customers wish to read more. I also included a clear CTA button allowing customers to easily book an appointment.

**Further Testing**

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- I used Lighthouse in Chrome Devtools to check for site performance, accessibility and best practices. Results: Performance 72, Accessibility 92, Best Practices 86 and SEO 91.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 &amp; iPhoneX.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
- During the development process I realised by commit messages were not descriptive or frequent enough. I realised this around commit number 15 and from that point on I provided more frequent and descriptive commits.
- During the development I realised that I needed to put my README assets in a separate folder for security reasons as we don&#39;t want to deploy them.

**Accessibility Testing:**

- Where icons were used I included the included the class aria-hidden=true so as not to confuse screen readers.
- Where possible I added span tag with a sr-only class and text for screen readers. The text will not be displayed on a regular screen.
- While using [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) to test the accessibility of the site I discovered some errors including missing labels on the contact us table and skipped h tags which I rectified.
- I also used alt tags on images where possible (the owner images on the About Us page).

**Usability Testing:**

- Where links were used to external sources such as social media links in the footer I included target\_blank to ensure these pages opened in a separate window so the user doesn&#39;t completely leave our page.

**Responsiveness Testing:**

- I used Bootstrap across the application to ensure that the pages were responsive on all devices. I this this across devices and also using Dev tools.

**Bugs Solved**

- The map on the Contact page was pushing into the footer on mobile devices. I rectified this by adjusting the height of the contents in the container. I also hid the map on smaller devices.
- I encountered a horizontal scrollbar during testing. On investigation it related to the container size of the footer of each page. I fixed the bug by altering the margin of the container so that the contents did not overflow.

**Further work to be done**

- Currently when the modal on the Services page to &quot;book an appointment&quot; is clicked, the popup does not go anywhere. In a future development project I would correct this. I will also create a confirmation pop-up for users to let them know that their request has been submitted.
- Similarly when the form on the Contact page is submitted it does not do anything. I will correct this by creating a pop-up thanking users for submitting the form. This will ensure a good user experience.

**De­­ployment**

**GitHub Pages**

I deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/asplesa/BaxtersMS1)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the &quot;Settings&quot; Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the &quot;GitHub Pages&quot; Section.
4. Under &quot;Source&quot;, click the dropdown called &quot;None&quot; and select &quot;Master Branch&quot;.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://asplesa.github.io/BaxtersMS1/index.html) in the &quot;GitHub Pages&quot; section.
